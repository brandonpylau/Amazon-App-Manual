# Amazon Shopping Mobile App User Guide
For this project, I developed a user guide for the Amazon Shopping Mobile App, focusing on organizing and structuring content to clearly highlight key product features. The experience strengthened my ability to communicate complex functions in a user-friendly way and effectively educate end users on app functionality.
